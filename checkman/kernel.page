 This check measures the swapped kernel pages. The amount of pages swapped from the kernel is returned as amount of byes swapped since the last boot and we monitor the rate of swapped pages in bytes/sec. You can set critical and warning level
 for both upper and lower borders. If no rule is set you get the current values for swapped pages in and out.
