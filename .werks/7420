On hosts which run Docker the ps section contained processes which belong
to Docker containers. This Werk omits these container processes and only
shows processes which do not belong to a Docker container. If the agent
is run in the context of a Docker container this filter is not applied.

If you want to use this feature a check_mk_agent including this Werk has
to be installed on the host.
