When editing the tags of a host they were not applied correctly to the configuration
right after saving. When opening the host edit dialog a second time and saving the
host again without a change, the host tags were saved correctly.

This issue could results in unexpected rule matching because the host dialog always
showed the correct value while the rule matching code did not receive the intended
tag configuration.

This issue was introduced with 1.5.0b1 by #5886.
